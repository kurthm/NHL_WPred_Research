# NHL_Win_Pred_Research


# Goal
The purpose of this project is to determine actionable insights as to how professional hockey teams win games. While win prediction models have been made in the past, they tend to focus on score and manpower which ultimately do not offer unique or profound counsel to coaching staff that can be implemented in practices. By studying the performance of a team based on in-game metrics we can learn what focuses are most important for players. 

# Data
The data used here comes from the NHL event (play-by-play) data from 2018-2019. We use only data from the regular season with the intent to later extend our model to playoffs. The data is too large to upload here, so only manipulation code is provided.

# Code
Because the main model has been created in R, I do the majority of the project using R code. The sections are labeled but the format of separation is intended for use within RStudio. Data manipulation could certainly be done using Pandas in Python.
