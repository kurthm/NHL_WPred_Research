# NHL_WPred_Research


# Goals
The purpose of this project is to determine actionable insights as to how professional hockey teams win games. While win prediction models have been made in the past, they tend to focus on score and manpower which ultimately do not offer unique counsel to coaching staff. By studying the performance of a team based on in-game metrics we can learn what focuses are most important for players. 

# Data
The data used here comes from the NHL event (play-by-play) data from 2018-2019. We use only data from the regular season with the intent to later extend our model to playoffs.

# Code
Because the main model has been created in R, I do the majority of the project using R code. Data manipulation could certainly be done using Pandas in Python.
